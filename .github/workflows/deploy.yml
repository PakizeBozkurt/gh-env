# A configuration file for a deployment process, likely used in a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. 

# The code starts by specifying the name of the deployment as "Deployment".

#The on section defines the triggers for this deployment. 
#In this case, it is triggered on a push event to the "main" or "dev" branches of the repository.

#The env section sets environment variables that will be used in the deployment process. 
#Here, it defines a variable called MONGODB_DB_NAME with the value "gha-node".
